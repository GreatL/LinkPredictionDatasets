Network Datasets for Link Prediction
1. USAir: Each node in this network corresponds to an airport, and each link corresponds to a direct flight route between two airports. A total of 332 airports and 2126 routes are included.
2. C.ele: Nodes in the network represent neurons of nematodes, and links represent synapses or gap junctions of neurons. 297 nodes and 2148 links are included in the network.
3. Power: This network is the power network of the western United States. The nodes represent substations or converter stations, and the links represent the high-voltage lines between them, containing 4941 nodes and 6594 links.
4. Router: The network is an Internet router-level network. The node indicates a router, and the link indicates that the routers are connected through optical fiber cables and other means and exchange data packets directly. It contains 5022 nodes and 6258 links.
5. Yeast: Nodes represent proteins, and links represent interactions in this network, which contains 2617 nodes and 11855 links.
6. PB: The nodes in this network correspond to the blog pages of a political forum in the US. If there is a hyperlink between two blogs, regardless of the direction, an undirected link is established between the corresponding blogs. A total of 1224 nodes and 16714 edges are included.
